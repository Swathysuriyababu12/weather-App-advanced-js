The provided code exemplifies a straightforward Weather App developed using a combination of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This application allows users to input a city name, select temperature units (metric or imperial), and then retrieves and displays real-time weather data for the specified location. Here's an overview of the code:

**HTML (index.html):**
The HTML file sets up the structure of the Weather App's user interface. It includes input fields for the city name and unit selection, as well as a button to initiate the weather data retrieval. The retrieved data is displayed in designated sections with placeholders for the city name, temperature, weather description, and weather icon.

**CSS (styles.css):**
The CSS file handles the visual design and layout of the Weather App. It creates a centered, card-like layout for the app's content. It also styles the input fields, button, and adds basic styling for the weather information sections. Additionally, it defines a class to style the weather icon.

**JavaScript (script.js):**
The JavaScript code is responsible for the functionality and interactivity of the Weather App. It interacts with the OpenWeatherMap API to fetch weather data based on user input. It includes event listeners that trigger the data retrieval when the user clicks the "Search" button or changes the unit selection. The retrieved weather data, including temperature, description, and icon code, is dynamically updated in the appropriate HTML elements.


**JavaScript Code Description:**

1. **Weather Icon and Units Selection:**
   - The code initializes variables `weatherIconElement` and `unitsSelect` to reference specific HTML elements by their IDs (`'weatherIcon'` and `'unitsSelect'` respectively).

   - An event listener is attached to the `unitsSelect` element. This listener triggers whenever the user changes the selected unit (metric or imperial).

   - Inside the event listener, the current city name from the `cityInput` element and the selected unit are extracted.

   - The `getWeatherData` function is then called with the city name and selected unit as arguments.

2. **Fetching and Displaying Weather Data:**
   - The `getWeatherData` function is asynchronous and aims to fetch weather data using the OpenWeatherMap API.

   - Within the function, an `await` statement fetches the weather data from the API based on the provided city name and selected units.

   - The weather data is parsed as JSON, and various elements of the retrieved data are utilized to populate the HTML elements within the Weather App's user interface.

   - The `cityNameElement` displays the name of the city.
   - The `temperatureElement` displays the temperature in the selected units (either Celsius or Fahrenheit).
   - The `weatherDescriptionElement` shows a description of the current weather conditions.

   - The `weatherIconCode` extracted from the API data corresponds to a specific weather condition, and this code is used to set the source and alt attributes of the `weatherIconElement`. The `src` attribute links to an image representing the current weather, while the `alt` attribute provides alternative text for screen readers and SEO.

3. **Error Handling:**
   - The code employs a `try`...`catch` block to handle potential errors that might occur during the data-fetching process.

   - If an error occurs (such as network issues or API-related problems), an error message is logged to the console.

In summary, this JavaScript code enhances the Weather App by allowing users to choose their preferred temperature unit and dynamically updating the weather icon to match the current conditions. By combining user interactivity, data fetching, and visual representation, the Weather App becomes more versatile and engaging for users seeking weather information for various locations.
